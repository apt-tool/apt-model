## How to avoid machine learning pitfalls: A guide for academic researchers

<br />

This was a research about how to avoid machine learning pitfalss by <b><i>Michael A. Lones</i></b> .<br /> 
This document gives a concise outline of some of the common mistakes that occur when using machine learning techniques, and what can be done to avoid them.

### Research Analysis

It’s normal to want to rush into training and evaluating models, 
but it’s important to take the time to think about the goals of a project, 
to fully understand the data that will be used to support these goals, to consider any limitations of the data that need to be addressed, a
nd to understand what’s already been done in your field. If you don’t do these things, 
then you may end up with results that are hard to publish, or models that are not appropriate for their intended purpose.

If you don’t have enough data, then it may not be possible to train a model that gener- alises. Working out whether this is the case can be challenging, and may not be evident until you start building models: it all depends on the signal to noise ratio in the data set.

Building models is one of the more enjoyable parts of ML. With modern ML frameworks, 
it’s easy to throw all manner of approaches at your data and see what sticks. However, this can lead to a disorganised mess of experiments that’s hard to justify and hard to write up. So, it’s important to approach model building in an organised manner, 
making sure you use data correctly, and putting adequate consideration into the choice of models.

In order to contribute to progress in your field, you need to have valid 
results that you can draw reliable conclusions from. Unfortunately it’s really 
easy to evaluate ML models unfairly, and, by doing so, muddy the waters of 
academic progress. So, think carefully about how you are going to use data in your experiments, 
how you are going to measure the true performance of your models, and how you are going to report this performance in a meaningful and informative way.

### Conclusion 

The aim of academic research is not self-aggrandisement, but rather an opportunity to contribute to knowledge. 
In order to effectively contribute to knowledge, you need to provide a complete picture of your work, covering both what worked and what didn’t. 
ML is often about trade-offs — it’s very rare that one model is better than another in every way that matters — and you should try to 
reflect this with a nuanced and considered approach to reporting results and conclusions.

This document doesn’t tell you everything you need to know, the lessons sometimes have no firm conclusions, 
and some of the things I’ve told you might be wrong, or at least debateable. This, I’m afraid, is the nature of research. The theory of how to do ML almost always lags behind the practice, academics will always disagree about the best ways of doing things, 
and what we think is correct today may not be correct tomorrow. Therefore, you have to approach ML in much the same way you would any other aspect of research: with an open mind, a willingness to keep up with recent developments, and the humility to accept you don’t know everything.
